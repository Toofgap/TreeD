              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>Machine learning is an important part of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being specifically programmed for each task. This powerful technology is changing many industries, from healthcare to finance, by making it easier to predict outcomes, automate tasks, and make smarter decisions. This case study covers the basics of machine learning, its types, how it works, its various uses, and the challenges in applying it, showing its vital role in advancing technology.</p>

              <h2>Machine Learning Overview</h2>
              <p>Machine learning (ML) is a field within AI and computer science that focuses on using data and algorithms to help computers learn in a way that mimics human learning, gradually improving their accuracy. It enables computers to find patterns and make predictions or decisions based on data without being directly programmed for every scenario. As computers process more data, they get better at making accurate predictions. ML is used in many areas, like personalized recommendations, self-driving cars, and voice recognition, making computers learn from experience, similar to how people do.</p>
            </section>

              <h2>Types of Machine Learning</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Supervised Learning</li>
                <p>This type of ML uses labeled data to train a model, where the correct answers are already known. The model learns to map inputs to the correct outputs so it can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.</p>
                <li>Unsupervised Learning</li>
                <p>Here, the model looks for patterns in data that isn’t labeled. It learns from the data without any specific guidance, making it more flexible and capable of discovering hidden patterns.</p>
                <li>Reinforcement Learning</li>
                <p>In this approach, an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The goal is to learn a strategy that maximizes rewards over time.</p>
              </ul>

              <p>
                The exploration of data, information, and information systems shows how important they are for the success and growth of modern organizations. In today’s digital world, where there’s more and more data being created, it’s really important to know the difference between raw data and useful information. Data, which is just raw facts and figures, needs to be processed and analyzed to become valuable information that helps with decision-making and planning.
              </p>
              <p>
                Information systems play a key role in this transformation. These systems, which include hardware, software, data, procedures, and people, work together to manage, store, and process data. By turning raw data into useful insights, information systems help organizations make informed decisions that can improve their efficiency and help them succeed. Different types of information systems, like Transaction Processing Systems (TPS), Management Information Systems (MIS), Decision Support Systems (DSS), Executive Information Systems (EIS), and Knowledge Management Systems (KMS), show the many ways data can be used to support various levels of decision-making in an organization.
              </p>
              <p>
                Transaction Processing Systems handle routine transactions and make sure they are accurate and efficient, while Management Information Systems give managers regular reports on performance to help them monitor and control activities. Decision Support Systems help with complex decisions by providing analytical tools and models, while Executive Information Systems offer top executives quick access to summarized data and key performance indicators. Knowledge Management Systems help with creating, sharing, and managing knowledge in an organization, which boosts collaboration and innovation.
              </p>

              <h2>TYPES OF NUMBER SYSTEMS</h2>
              <h3>DECIMAL (BASE 10)</h3>
              <p>The most familiar number system in daily life, consisting of ten unique digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
              <p>Example: In 347, 3 represents 3 × 10², 4 represents 4 × 10¹, and 7 represents 7 × 10⁰.</p>
              
              <h3>BINARY (BASE 2)</h3>
              <p>Used in digital electronics and computers, using only 0 and 1.</p>
              <p>Example: 101 in binary equals 5 in decimal (1 × 2² + 0 × 2¹ + 1 × 2⁰).</p>
              
              <h3>OCTAL (BASE 8)</h3>
              <p>Uses eight digits: 0 through 7. A base-8 system simplifying binary numbers.</p>
              <p>Example: 11010110 in binary equals 326 in octal.</p>
              
              <h3>HEXADECIMAL (BASE 16)</h3>
              <p>Uses 16 symbols: 0-9 and A-F.</p>
              <p>Example: 11111010 in binary equals FA in hexadecimal.</p>
